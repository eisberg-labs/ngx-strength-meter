## API

### Inputs

- *value: string*: The password input for which the strength will be calculated.

### Outputs

- *measure: EventEmitter<number>*: Emits the strength score (0 to 4) when the strength is calculated. Explanations on the [meaning of grades is here](https://github.com/dropbox/zxcvbn), but you can guess that 0 is bad, 4 is good.
